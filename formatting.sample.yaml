Format1:

# Output Format parameter allows selection of the format that the file is converted to.

# Transformations are specified in an array under the transformations key.  Any number 
# of transformations may be specified.  The simplest format for specifying a transformation
# is by specifying the field/column name (or number) as a key, followed by key-value pairs for
# one or more transformation functions.  Examples are given below:  
 transformations:
  # The 'oldtext' key may be used for replacing or removing text from a field
  # For the field LAW_FIRM_MATTER_ID, this REMOVES the text specified in "oldtext"
  - LAW_FIRM_MATTER_ID:
     oldtext: "XXXXX-"
  # Same as above, but with different "oldtext"
  # Note that the same field may be transformed multiple times.
  - LAW_FIRM_MATTER_ID:
     oldtext: "YYYYY-"
  # For actual replacement, the 'newtext' key should also be specified.
  # For the field INVOICE_NUMBER, this REPLACES the text in "oldtext" with the text in "newtext"   
  - INVOICE_NUMBER:
     oldtext: "-"
     newtext: ":"
  # The 'source' key may be used for copying content from another field.
  # This COPIES the contents from LAW_FIRM_ID to CLIENTS_TAX_ID
  - CLIENT_TAX_ID:
     source: LAW_FIRM_ID
  # Multiple transformations may be specified at once, but only one of each kind.  The order
  # of operations is set in the app.  
  # This copies INVOICE_TOTAL to INVOICE_NET_TOTAL and removes the $
  - INVOICE_NET_TOTAL:
     source: INVOICE_TOTAL
     oldtext: "$"
  # The 'value' key may be used to set the value of a field to specified text.
  # This SETS the value of the field PO_NUMBER to the specified text
  - PO_NUMBER:
     value: "199079"
  # This SETS the field INVOICE_DESCRIPTION to empty
  - INVOICE_DESCRIPTION:
     value: ''
  # This 'upper' key may be used to change text to all caps  
  - TIMEKEEPER_LAST_NAME:
     upper: true
  # This 'lower' key may be used to change text to all caps  
  - TIMEKEEPER_LAST_NAME:
     lower: true    
  # The 'split' key may be used to split a field up into multiple portions using the
  # specified separator.  By default, only the first portion is kept.  To keep a different
  # portion, the 'index' key may be used (first = 0, second = 1, etc)
  # This takes everything before the first slash in CLIENT_MATTER_ID
  - CLIENT_MATTER_ID:
     split: "/"
  # This takes the second portion / everything between the first and second hyphen in LAW_FIRM_MATTER_ID
  - LAW_FIRM_MATTER_ID:
     split: "-"
     index: 1
  # As a more complex example, this copies TIMEKEEPER_NAME to TIMEKEEPER_FIRST_NAME, changes it
  # to all caps, splits it by commas (more specificaly, the substring ", ", and keeps the second portion
  - TIMEKEEPER_LAST_NAME:
     source: TIMEKEEPER_NAME
     upper: true
     split: ", "
     index: 1
  # The 'map' key allows you to specify a mapping of key-value pairs.  If the field matches any
  # one of these keys (exactly), it will be replaced with the corresponding value.  Hence, in 
  # the example below, when TIMEKEEPER_ID is XXX, it is replaced with 1
  - TIMEKEEPER_ID:
     map: { 'XXX': 1, 'YYY': 2, 'ZZZ': 3 , 'AAA': 0, 'BBB': 20, 'CCC': 'None' }
  # An alternative format for specifying a transformation is by specifying the name or number of the field(s)
  # you wish to change as the value to a field key, with the transofrmation(s) listed at the same level as
  # the field key.  For instance, this sets PO_NUMBER to 199079
  - field: PO_NUMBER
    value: "199079"
  # And this is the same as the TIME_KEEPER_LAST_NAME example above
  - TIMEKEEPER_LAST_NAME:
    source: TIMEKEEPER_NAME
    upper: true
    split: ", "
    index: 1
  # A benefit to doing it this way, is that you can apply the same transformation to multiple fields at
  # at the same time.  For instance, this sets all of the listed fields to 0
  - field: [LINE_ITEM_TAX_RATE,LINE_ITEM_TAX_TOTAL,INVOICE_REPORTED_TAX_TOTAL]
    value: 0
  # Finally, you may specify a field/column number in place of the column name.  Remember that 0
  # is the first number.  These are the last two transformations using column numbers instead of names.
  - 24:
     value: "199079"
  - field: [47,48,50]
    value: 0


# Autoselect allows you to specify one or more values to check for in one or more fields to see if this is the
# correct conversion setting.  The app looks only at the values of the fields in the first line item of the LEDES file.  
# This parameter is optional. 
 autoselect:
  # For instance, this line looks for XXXXX in the CLIENT_ID field
  CLIENT_ID: XXXXX
  # As another example, this line looks for Bob or Jane in the TIMEKEEPER_NAME field
  TIMEKEEPER_NAME: ["Bob","Jane"]
  # As another example, this line looks for XX-XXXXX in field index 25 (the CLIENT_TAX_ID field)
  25: "XX-XXXX"


# Any number of additional settings may be specified in the same manner
Others:
 output_format: 1998B
 # and so on
